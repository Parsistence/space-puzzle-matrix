1. Generate a Grid
   * Use a clear pattern for easier skill levels
   * Use a randomized grid for more skilled user
2. Computer randomly picks 1-3 tiles to apply a flip to
   * Make sure the computer never flips the same tile twice in a row
   * For easier levels: Don't worry about overlap between flipped squares
   * For harder levels: Make sure every flip overlaps at least a little with previous ones
3. Player is given 1-3 turns to make flips. Display shows the desired result, lives left, turns left, etc.
